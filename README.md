## Introduction [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

The kanin library is a wrapper for various modules in the Erlang AMQP client
library. kanin was created in order to not only provide a less verbose AMQP
client library for LFE hackers, but one that was also more Lispy.


## Dependencies [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

As of version 0.3.0 of kanin, the latest version of lfetool is required
(currently lfetool 1.5.0-dev). This is due to the fact that kanin has started
using the ``lfe.config`` file to override rebar dependencies. kanin uses the
latest development release of LFE in order to support including various
RabbitMQ Erlang header files, and since other dependencies use the latest
release of LFE (0.9.0), we needed to override rebar's behaviour (see the rebar
bug [#170](https://github.com/rebar/rebar/issues/170)).

To install the latest development version of lfetool:

```bash
$ curl -L -o ./lfetool https://raw.github.com/lfe/lfetool/dev-v1/lfetool
$ bash ./lfetool install
```


## Installation [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

To pull in kanin as part of your project, just add it to your ``rebar.config``
deps:

```erlang
  {deps, [
    ...
    {kanin, ".*",
      {git, "git@github.com:billosys/kanin.git", "master"}}
      ]}.
```

And then do:

```bash
    $ make compile
```

This will take a little while, as it builds the Erlang RabbitMQ client library
from source. If you have ``amqp_lib`` on your ``$ERL_LIBS`` path, then you can
do this instead:

```bash
    $ make skip-rabbit
```

## Documentation [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

Below, in the "Usage" section, you will find information about using Kanin
with RabbitMQ in LFE projects.

Also, you may be interested in the [Kanin
tutorials](http://billo.gitbooks.io/lfe-rabbitmq-tutorials/), which
have been translated into LFE from the official RabbitMQ docs for Python and Erlang.


## Supported Modules [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

The following ``amqp_*`` modules have been included in kanin:
 * ``amqp_channel`` -> ``kanin-chan``
 * ``amqp_connection`` -> ``kanin-conn``
 * ``amqp_uri`` -> ``kanin-uri``

If your favorite ``amqp_*`` module is not among those, feel free to submit a
new ticket requesting the addition of your desired module(s) or submit a
pull request with the desired inclusion added.


## Usage [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

### The LFE AMQP Client Library [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

The AMQP client provides an Erlang interface to compliant AMQP brokers. The
client follows the AMQP execution model and implements the wire level
marshaling required to encode and decode AMQP commands in a protocol
conformant fashion. AMQP is a connection orientated protocol and multiplexes
parallel interactions via multiple channels within a connection.

This user guide assumes that the reader is familiar with basic concepts of AMQP
and understands exchanges, queues and bindings. This information is contained in
the protocol documentation on the AMQP website. For details and exact
definitions, please see
[the AMQP specification document](http://www.amqp.org/).

The basic usage of the client follows these broad steps:

 * Establish a connection to a broker
 * Create a new channel within the open connection
 * Execute AMQP commands with a channel such as sending and receiving messages,
   creating exchanges and queue or defining routing rules between exchanges and
   queues
 * When no longer required, close the channel and the connection


### Programming Model [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

Once a connection has been established, and a channel has been opened, an
LFE application will typically use the ``kanin-chan:call/{2,3}`` and
``kanin-chan:cast/{2,3}`` functions to achieve most of the things it needs to
do.

The underlying Erlang AMQP client library is made up of two layers:

 * A high level logical layer that follows the AMQP execution model, and
 * A low level driver layer that is responsible for providing a physical
   transport to a broker.

There are two drivers in the client library:

 * The network driver establishes a TCP connection to a protocol compliant AMQP
   broker and encodes each command according to the specification. To use this
   driver, start a connection using ``kanin-conn:start/1`` with the parameter
   set to an ``#amqp_params_network`` record.

 * The direct driver uses native Erlang messaging instead of sending AMQP
   encoded commands over TCP. This approach avoids the overhead of marshaling
   commands onto and off the wire. However, the direct driver can only be used
   in conjunction with the RabbitMQ broker and the client code must be deployed
   into the same Erlang cluster. To use the direct driver, start a connection
   using ``kanin-conn:start/1`` with the parameter set to an
   ``#amqp_params_direct`` record.

At run-time, the Erlang client library re-uses a subset of the functionality
from the RabbitMQ broker. In order to keep the a client deployment independent
of RabbitMQ, the Erlang client build process produces an archive containing all
of the common modules. This archive is then put onto the load path of the client
application.

For more detailed information on the API, please refer to the reference
documentation.

Furthermore, the test suite that is part of the source distribution of the
client library contains many complete examples of how to program against the
API.


### AMQP Commands [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

The general mechanism of interacting with the broker is to send and receive AMQP
commands that are defined in the protocol documentation. During build process,
the machine-readable version of the AMQP specification is used to auto-generate
Erlang records for each command. The code generation process also defines
sensible default values for each command. Using default values allows the
programmer to write terser code - it is only necessary to override a field if
you require non-default behaviour. The definition of each command can be
consulted in the ``include/rabbit-framing.lfe`` header file. For example,
when using the ``(make-exchange.declare ...)`` record-creating macro,
specifying the following:

```cl
(make-exchange.declare exchange (list_to_binary "my_exchange"))
```

is equivalent to this:

```cl
(make-exchange.declare
  exchange (list_to_binary "my_exchange")
  ticket 0
  type (list_to_binary "direct")
  passive 'false
  durable 'false
  auto_delete 'false
  internal 'false
  nowait 'false
  arguments '())
```

### Including Header Files [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

The LFE client uses a number of record definitions which you will encounter
in this guide. These records fall into two broad categories:

* Auto-generated AMQP command definitions from the machine readable version of
  the specification
* Definitions of data structures that are commonly used throughout the client

To gain access to these records, you need to include the ``amqp-client.lfe``
file in every module that uses the Erlang client:

```cl
(include-lib "kanin/include/amqp-client.lfe")
```


### Connecting to a Broker [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

The ``kanin-conn`` module is used to start a connection to the broker:

```cl
...
  (let* ((net-opts (make-amqp_params_network host "localhost"))
         (`#(ok ,connection) (kanin-conn:start net-opts))
         ...))
...
```

This function returns ``#(ok ,connection)``, where ``connection`` is the pid of a
process that maintains a permanent connection to the broker.

In case of an error, the above call returns ``#(error ,error)``.

The example above has just ``"localhost"`` as a parameter. However, there will
often be many more than that.

An AMQP broker contains objects organised into groups called virtual hosts. The
concept of virtual hosts gives an administrator the facility to partition a
broker resource into separate domains and restrict access to the objects
contained within these groups. AMQP connections require client authentication
and the authorisation to access specific virtual hosts.

The ``(make-amqp_params_network)`` record macro sets the following default
values:

| Parameter         |  Default Value  |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| username          |  guest          |
| password          |  guest          |
| virtual_host      |  /              |
| host              |  localhost      |
| post              |  5672           |
| channel_max       |  0              |
| frame_max         |  0              |
| heartbeat         |  0              |
| ssl_options       |  none           |
| auth_mechanisms   |  ``(list #'amqp_auth_mechanisms:plain/3 #'amqp_auth_mechanisms:amqplain/3)`` |
| client_properties |  ``'()``        |

These values are only the defaults that will work with an out of the box broker
running on the same host. If the broker or the environment has been configured
differently, these values can be overridden to match the actual deployment
scenario.

SSL options can also be specified globally using the ``ssl_options`` environment
key for the ``amqp-client`` application. They will be merged with the SSL
parameters from the URI (the latter will take precedence).

If a client wishes to run inside the same Erlang cluster as the RabbitMQ broker,
it can start a direct connection that optimises away the AMQP codec. To start a
direct connection, use ``kanin-conn:start/1`` with the parameter set to an
``(make-amqp_params_direct)`` record.

Providing a username and password is optional, since the direct client is
considered trusted anyway. If a username and password are provided then they
will be checked and made available to authentication backends. If a username is
supplied, but no password, then the user is considered trusted and logged in
unconditionally. If neither username nor password are provided then the
connection will be considered to be from a "dummy" user which can connect to any
virtual host and issue any AMQP command.

The ``(make-amqp_params_direct)`` record macro sets the following default
values:

| Parameter         |  Default Value  |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| username          |  guest          |
| password          |  guest          |
| virtual_host      |  /              |
| node              |  ``(node)``     |
| client_properties |  ``'()``        |


### Connecting To A Broker with AMQP URIs [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

Instead of working the ``(make-amqp_params_*)`` records directly, [AMQP
URIs](https://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html) may be used. The
``(kanin-uri:parse/1)`` function is provided for this purpose. It parses an URI
and returns the equivalent ``amqp_params_*`` record. Diverging from the spec,
if the hostname is omitted, the connection is assumed to be direct and an
``amqp_params_direct`` record is returned. In addition to the standard host,
port, user, password and vhost parameters, extra parameters may be specified via
the query string (e.g. ``"?heartbeat=5"``).

AMQP URIs are defined with the following ABNF rules:

```
amqp_URI       = "amqp://" amqp_authority [ "/" vhost ] [ "?" query ]
amqp_authority = [ amqp_userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
amqp_userinfo  = username [ ":" password ]
username       = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )
password       = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )
vhost          = segment
```

Here are some examples:

| Parameter                                      | Username | Password | Host    | Port  | Vhost   |
|------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| amqp://alice:secret@host:10000/vhost           | "alice"  | "secret" | "host"  | 10000 | "vhost" |
| amqp://bo%62:%73ecret@h%6fst:10000/%76host     | "bob"    | "secret" | "host"  | 10000 | "vhost" |
| amqp://                                        |          |          |         |       |         |
| amqp://:@/                                     | ""       | ""       |         |       | ""      |
| amqp://carol@                                  | "carol"  |          |         |       |         |
| amqp://dave:secret@                            | "dave"   | "secret" |         |       |         |
| amqp://host                                    |          |          | "host"  |       |         |
| amqp://:10000                                  |          |          |         | 10000 |         |
| amqp:///vhost                                  |          |          |         |       | "vhost" |
| amqp://host/                                   |          |          | "host"  |       | ""      |
| amqp://host/%2f                                |          |          | "host"  |       | "/"     |
| amqp://[::1]                                   |          |          | "[::1]" |       |         |

If you prefer, you can use connection URIs in Kanin. Updating the previous
example:

```cl
...
  (let* ((net-opts (kanin-uri:parse "amqp://localhost"))
         (`#(ok ,connection) (kanin-conn:start net-opts))
         ...))
```
